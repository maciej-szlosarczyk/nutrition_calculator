# NutritionCalculator

A simple module to perform calculations of various nutrition-related data for a
specific person.

It was created so I can explore the features of Elixir type system and dialyzer.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nutrition_calculator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:nutrition_calculator, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/nutrition_calculator](https://hexdocs.pm/nutrition_calculator).
